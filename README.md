**Programming Assignment 10: Geolocation**

**Part A: Location Data**

The code we are writing will be more interesting to use if we have a lot of data to work with.  Companies like Google have invested significant resources in identifying places of interest and recording their names, addresses, and locations along with some tags that are relevant for searching.  We donâ€™t have the resources of a company like Google, but we have a lot of students.  So we will use a crowdsourcing approach by having each student provide information for at least 10 places of interest in the general Flagstaff area.  You can include any place that you think an NAU student would be likely to go including, for example, restaurants near the airport.
